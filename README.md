## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a 6-phase process flow:

1. **Teacher Flow** (Blue) - Session creation and beacon setup
2. **Student Flow** (Green) - Proximity detection and data capture
3. **Backend Processing** (Orange) - Data validation and routing
4. **Security Checks** (Red) - Anti-proxy verification layers
5. **Database Storage** (Purple) - Secure data persistence
6. **Response Flow** (Gray) - User feedback and alerts

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: n8n workflow automation
- **Database**: Google Sheets integration
- **Frontend**: Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Connectivity**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- **Security**: Multi-factor device verification
